Making indicator lights for a helmet using ESP8266s.

I am initially basing the code of a great article by Pooja Agarwal found here https://blog.zairza.in/esp8266-to-esp8266-communication-without-a-router-fe9642b93292

The light housing is designed to fit into the air vent holes on the back of my helmet.
I haven't designed the control box yet, there are two designs I am considering,

1. Have the control box and all the electronics (battery, ESP8266, buttons, etc.) mounted on the handle bars.
2. Have just the buttons mounted on the handel bars and have the electronics in my scooters battery box.

The second design has the advantage of having the electronics mounted in a waterproof box and possible access to power, so no need to have a second battery and charging setup.
